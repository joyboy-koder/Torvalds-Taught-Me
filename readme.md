# 🐧 TorvaldsTaughtMe

> Not actually taught by Linus Torvalds... but definitely learning Linux like he did.

## 📖 About
**TorvaldsTaughtMe** is my personal Linux learning project — where I document everything I learn about Linux through commands, experiments, and small projects.  

This isn’t just note-taking — it’s a creative space to track my progress as a self-taught developer exploring the Linux system deeply, one terminal command at a time.

## ⚙️ What You’ll Find Here
Each repository or section in this project represents something I’ve explored, such as:
- 🧍 `who` and `w` — checking logged-in users  
- 📂 File & directory commands  
- ⚙️ System and process tools  
- 🔐 Permissions and user management  
- 💡 Little web experiments showing Linux in action

## 🚀 My Goal
To understand Linux from the inside out , not just to use it, but to *feel* comfortable in it.  
Every command, every error, and every success gets me one step closer to becoming a true Linux power user.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
I’ll be sharing short write-ups for each new Linux concept I learn — what it does, how it works, and how I tested it.  
Some will have HTML/CSS/JS demos to make the learning more interactive.
