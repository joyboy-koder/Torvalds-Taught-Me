## Overview

The **Who & W Simulator** is a browser-based interactive terminal that simulates some of the most common Linux user commands for educational purposes.  
This project is designed for beginners to explore Linux commands in a fun, interactive way, **without needing to install Linux on their machine**.

It currently features the following commands:

- `who` – shows which users are currently logged in  
- `who -b` – displays the last system boot time  
- `who -q` – shows all login names and the number of users logged in  
- `w` – shows who is logged in and what they are doing  
- `w -h` – short format without the header  
- `w -s` – short format summary  
- `help` – lists all available commands and their explanations  

> Users can type commands in the terminal input and press **Enter** to see the simulated output. The `help` command explains what each command does.

## Features

- Interactive **text input** that responds like a real Linux terminal  
- **Simulated command outputs** for `who` and `w` variants  
- Realistic **terminal formatting** with prompt, colors, and indentation  
- Educational: shows command usage for beginners

## How to Use

1. Open (https://joyboy-koder.github.io/Linux-Who-W-Simulator/) in your browser.  
2. Type a command in the terminal input (e.g., `who`, `w`, `help`).  
3. Press **Enter** to execute the command and see the output.

## Notes

- This is a **learning project**, so outputs are **simulated** for demonstration purposes.  
- Only a subset of `who` and `w` commands are implemented so far. There are many more options available in Linux (e.g., `whoami`, `w -f`, `w -i`).  
- Future expansions could include more commands and features, or even a fully interactive Linux shell simulation.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** – structure of the terminal  
- **CSS** – custom styling to mimic a terminal interface  
- **JavaScript** – handles user input, command execution, and dynamic outputs

🧠 This project was built with guidance and examples while I was learning Linux.
I modified and tested everything myself to understand how it works.

**Happy Learning!** 🚀
